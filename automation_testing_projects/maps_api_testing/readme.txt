This Python automation testing project focuses on testing the API for creating, updating, getting, and deleting new locations on a map. The project is organized into three main folders: logs, tests, and utils.

- logs: This folder is intended to store log files generated by the logger.py utility.

- tests: This folder contains a test file (test_google_maps_.py). The test_google_maps_.py file contains a test class (TestCreatePlace) with methods for testing the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of a new location using the Google Maps API.

- utils: This folder contains various utility files to support the testing process:
    - api.py: Defines the GoogleMapsApi class with methods for interacting with the Google Maps API, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting new locations.
    - checking.py: Contains the Checking class, which provides methods for checking status codes, JSON responses, and JSON values in API responses.
    - http_methods.py: Implements the HttpMethods class that provides HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for making requests to the API.
    - logger.py: Defines the Logger class, which logs API requests and responses, including timestamps, request methods, URLs, and other relevant information.
